Kudotsu-Prototype
=================

Topic: Prototype for Kudotsu Ceed project using MVC5, Windows Azure cloud platform and Azure storage table in C#.

The following content is the detail for the prototype.

I provide two versions for the prototype.

1. The application is built with Visual studio 2010 in C# due to the old OS on my machine.(The MVC5 need Windows 7 SP1 or later)


2. It takes me almost 1 day to install the latest OS and visial studio 2013 on my machine. But this version was made by local DB + MVC5 on azure.
